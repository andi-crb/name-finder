# name-finder

As I'm a writer, I want to make a name generator that will generate a likely name for a character born in NZ in a particular year, using the DIA and Stats NZ sites.

(This is not exactly a game, but I feel it falls within the broader scope of this challenge, and is something I'm fired up to do.)

Minimum functionality: generates a random name from a particular year.
